My second little post, See [Page layout](https://kitian616.github.io/jekyll-TeXt-theme/samples.html#page-layout) for more examples.
Here is some content for my blog post. I'm really excited to share this with you all. In this post, I will be discussing the importance of header images in blog posts and how they can enhance the overall visual appeal of your content.

Header images serve as a visual representation of your blog post and can help grab the reader's attention. They can also set the tone and theme of your post, making it more engaging and memorable.

In this post, I will be showcasing some examples of blog posts with header images and explaining how you can add them to your own posts using the TeXt theme. I will also provide some tips and best practices for choosing the right header image that aligns with your content.

So stay tuned for the full post and get ready to level up your blog with stunning header images!

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  printf("Hello, World!");
  return 0;
}
```
